# Contributing :hugs:

Thank you for considering contributing to the skift operating system.
To get your pr through the review process as fast as possible, here are some do's and don'ts to try to stick to:

- Conform to the projet [coding style](coding_style.md). Please use `clang-format` with the `.clang-format` file included with the project.
- When committing, the first line of your commit message should be "category: Brief description of what's being changed". The "category" can be a subdirectory, but also something like "POSIX compliance" or "module-name". Whatever seems logical.
- Don't touch anything outside the stated scope of the PR.
- Don't iterate excessively on your design across multiple commits.
